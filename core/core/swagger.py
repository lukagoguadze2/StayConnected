## Authentication
App uses token-based authentication. To authenticate, include an `Authorization` header in your requests with the value `Bearer <access_token>`.
To obtain an access token, you need to register a new user and log in with an existing account. for that you can use the following endpoints:
 **https:/(baseURL)/api/auth/signup/** - to register a new user
 **https:/(baseURL)/api/auth/login/** - to log in with an existing account

- **Signup request example**
request type: POST
request body:
```json 
{
    "username": "user1",
    "email": "example@gmail.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_2": "password123"
}
```

- **Login request example**
request type: POST
request body:
```json 
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```

Successful login will return a response with an access and refresh tokens that you can use to authenticate subsequent requests and refresh the access token.

- **response example**
response body:
```json
{
  "refresh": "refresh_token",
  "access": "access_token"
}
```

**Save** the tokens and include the access token in the `Authorization` header for all requests that require authentication.
**Use** refresh token to get a new access token and refresh tokens when the current one expires.


- **Logout**
To log out and invalidate the access token, you can use the following endpoint:
**https:/(baseURL)/api/auth/logout/**
request type: POST
request body: 
```json
{
  "refresh": "refresh_token"
}
```
response body if refresh token was not provided: 
```json
{
  "detail": "Token is invalid or expired",
  "code": "token_not_valid"
}
```
response body if refresh token was provided:
```json
{ }
```
**Note:** Not returning any response body for now, would be better if it does.

## Tokens 
Access tokens are valid for 1 hour, and refresh tokens are valid for 1 day. When an access token expires, you can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token and refresh token.

- **Access token**

    - Used to authenticate requests
    - Include in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <access_token>` for all requests that require authentication

- **Refresh token**
    - Valid for 1 day
    - Used to obtain a new access token and refresh token
    - Include in the request body when refreshing the access token
    
To refresh the access token, you can use the following endpoint:
**https:/(baseURL)/api/token/refresh/**

- **Refresh token request example**
request type: POST
request body:
```json 
{
   "refresh": "refresh_token"

- **Profile response example**
response body:
```json
{
  "username": "username",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "is_active": boolean,
  "is_staff": boolean
}
